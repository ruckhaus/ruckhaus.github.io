Assignment 1
6 February 2014

I'm fairly certain everything was implemented correctly, though it's not a completely responsive design because all of the <div>s have fixed widths and padding.
The only issue is that, for whatever reason, my resume page is slightly off-center (compared to the index and bio pages). I don't know why that is, since all of the <div>s are the same width and the left and right margins are set to "auto".

I did not collaborate or discuss with anyone.

I spent roughly 10-11 hours on this assignment.
Most of that time was spent on CSS. I think I could have been a little more creative with the design, but I wanted the pages to look clean and simple.


NOTES:
=========================================================
--I spent way too much time trying to style the navbar.
--I committed a lot in the beginning because I didn't
  realize I could see how it looks without committing.
