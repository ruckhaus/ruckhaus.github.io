17 days late, but I finally accomplished my 2016 goal of publishing this thing! It's 6 months in the making (or 2.5 years depending on when one chooses to start counting), and I'm pretty satisfied with what I have though I have some ideas for updates and improvements. The one bummer is how GitHub handles custom domains (which killed one of the main features of the only project I have up), but now I can focus on some other stuff like Python, which is the next thing on my list.
