Hey! I'm Sarah! By day, I'm a BIM Engineer specializing in Virtual Design and Construction (VDC). By night I like to pretend to dabble in web development, and that's why this site exists. It's primarily a place to play with my skills and also showcase some of my work.

The site also has a blog, which I'll use for whatever's on my mind since it's less trafficked (and therefore slightly less public) than my social media accounts. It's also slightly more professional than using the tumblr I had in college.

My interests include climbing, running, [November Project][1], soccer, big data, reading, swing dance, kayaking, politics, music, binge-watching TV, and occasionally Zumba. I'm also pretty good at bar trivia: my strengths include state capitals and Canada.
