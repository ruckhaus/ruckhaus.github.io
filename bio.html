      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p id="cooley">"I am not what I think I am and I am not what you think I am; I am what I think that you think I am." -- Charles Cooley</p>
      <p>Hey there! If you're on this page, you're probably expecting me to introduce myself. In that case...</p>

      <ul>
	<li>"Sarah, senior, civil engineering" is the introduction I've been giving recently at various CEE-related events. Even the ones with all seniors or all civil engineers because it's become a habit.</li>
	<li>I'm one of those weird kids taking Web Programming despite the fact that I'm not a computer science major.</li>
	<li>My focus in civil engineering is in structures. Basically, I like building stuff.</li>
	<li>Building (ha) on that last point, I'm not sure why it took so long to figure out that I should major in civil engineering (October of sophomore year if anyone cares). I've loved playing with LEGOs and K'Nex and the like my whole life. <span class="italic">C'est la vie.</span></li>
	<li>Despite the shame that may be associated with it this NHL season, I'm a diehard Buffalo Sabres fan.</li>
	<li>My favorite bands are Bastille and The Gaslight Anthem.</li>
	<li>My senior quote in high school was:
	  <blockquote cite="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=479958">"You go to a symphony orchestra and the first violin is elegant and there is a spotlight on her and she is in the front row and then there's a guy like me in the back row blowing on a tuba. They don't start the show until we both sit down."</blockquote>
	  and I'd say it adequately sums up my personality and my high school experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>So that's me. If you're interested in my experiences, head on over to my resume. Otherwise, check out this <a href="../images/jello-bounce.gif">gif of Jello bouncing in slow motion</a>.</p>
