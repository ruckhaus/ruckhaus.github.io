			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm North Jersey born and raised. I'm (hopefully) a 2014 graduate of the Tufts University School of Engineering with a B.S. in Civil Engineering. My dream job is to be a LEGO Master Builder, but I'm also interested in structural engineering and web development.</p>
			<h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>My favorite sport is hockey. My favorite team is the Buffalo Sabres, but I also like the St. Louis Blues, Colorado Avalanche, and San Jose Sharks.</li>
				<li>I've recently re-discovered soccer (football), and I support Everton FC and AFC Wimbledon.</li>
				<li>My favorite bands are Bastille and The Gaslight Anthem.</li>
				<li>I consider myself a mediocre multi-instrumentalist. I have experience with guitar, piano, bass guitar, ukulele, and saxophone (alto and baritone).</li>
				<li>I like learning new things, which would explain why I still play 3 instruments but I'm not proficeint at any of them.</li>
				<li>My weaknesses include french fries, banana chips, and a good cheeseburger.</li>
