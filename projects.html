  <h3><a href="../comp20-sruckhaus/transit/">MBTA Station Locator</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Skills used:</strong> Javascript, Google Maps API, HTML, CSS<br />
    When this project was created in March 2014, it had an additional AJAX component where it retrieved information from a <em>rodeo.json</em> file that returned a random MBTA heavy rail line (the Green Line did not have live tracking), then determined the user's nearest T stop on that line, as well as schedule information for trains at all stops on that line. That file no longer exists, so that portion of the project was removed. Now it displays the user's nearest stop on a randomly generated line and other stops on that line. In the future, I would like to add realtime info and the Green Line.</p>
