  <h4>MBTA Station Locator</h4>
  <p>When this project was created in Spring 2014, it had an additional component where
    it made an XML request to a <em>rodeo.json</em> file that returned a random MBTA line
    (only Red, Orange, and Blue because the Green Line did not have live tracking), then
    determined the user's nearest T stop on that line, as well as schedule information for
    trains on that line at all stops. That file no longer exists, so
    that portion of the project was removed. Now it displays the user's nearest stop
    and other stops on that line. In the future I would like to add realtime info and
    the Green Line.</p>
